# Crit Session Context

## Emerging Preferences
User thinks like a working DJ, not a product manager. Values the browsing/set-building experience over import mechanics. Sees import as tactical and infrequent — the catalog is the daily workspace. Thinks about future extensibility (multiple sources, AI generation, local files) and wants architecture that accommodates it. Prefers designs where the primary activity gets the primary surface. Quick to decide when options align with DJ workflow intuition — doesn't need multiple rounds when the answer is clear.

DJ software reference points: Rekordbox, Traktor, Serato. Catalog/crate takes most of the screen. Left column browser for genres/artists/labels. Top area for waveforms/decks. The catalog and ways to slice/dice the collection are the core experience.

Favors v1 discipline — ship what works now, expand when content justifies it. Saves ambitious layouts (Browser + Crate) for v2 rather than shipping half-baked.

## What Exists
- **Screen Inventory** — Catalog-First: 1 primary screen (Track Catalog as home base) + 1 secondary (Import Sheet as overlay/drawer). Import is one of many future actions that feed into the catalog. Locked option: option-c. User signal: "DJs browse far more than they import. The catalog IS the product. Import, AI generation, and future sources are all secondary actions that feed into it."
- **Edge States** — Context-Rich: tailored edge states per situation. Empty catalog shows source cards. URL errors show valid examples. Errors reassure "your tracks are safe." Partial imports show per-track results. Shaped skeletons for loading. Locked option: option-b. User signal: "Context-rich approach is the right fit for this product."

## How It's Arranged
- **Layout** — Full-Width Crate: edge-to-edge track table with sortable columns (Title, Artist, BPM, Key, Genre, Source). 48px collapsed icon rail reserves space for future browser pane. No max-width — DJ software density. Locked option: option-b. User signal: "B to get started, save C (Browser + Crate) for the next round. V1 discipline."
